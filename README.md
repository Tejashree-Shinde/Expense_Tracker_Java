This project has been entirely made in Java . I have created one class of Transaction which has properties of Amount , Category  and Date .
I am giving interface where user can 
  1. enter transaction
  2. See all transaction
  3. See monthly summary

I am storing this array in JSON format in JSON file . I have chose JSON because , most of the data passed through web is in JSON format , So we can pass this array to frontend also.
